SS.JS changelog (0.8.0 -> 0.9.0)

Bug fixes:

* ss.js:    Firefox (70.0.1) wasn't happy with static arrow functions.
* ss.js:    "Illegal variable reference before declaration: message", referring to "constructor(message = 'Unknown error: ' + message)" (the constructor of UnknownError).
* ss.js:    "Illegal variable reference before declaration: product", referring to the String.prototype.multiply() method.
* ss.js:    "The types of the getter and setter for property 'value' do not match."
** ss.js:   ControlKey's "code" property is now called "codePoint".
* ss.js:    Class inheritance doesn't work when the parent class is ES6 and the child class is ES5. Class WebService has therefore been restored to its old IE5 format.
* ss.js:    checkOptionalArgumentFull() threw an error if the specified argument was null or undefined.
* ss.js:    "Missing '...' in type annotation for rest parameter." warning solved by correcting the documentation.
* ss.js:    Lambda problem solved with String.prototype.loopThroughCharCodes(). In the loop the character index wasn't taken into account.

New features:

* ss.js:    Addition of methods HTMLDocument.prototype.removeElementsByDomIdTemplate() and HTMLDocument.prototype.deleteElementsByDomIdTemplate().
* ss.js:    More documentation for checkRequiredArgumentFull() and checkOptionalArgumentFull().
* ss.js:    The string template escape character is now specified in options-ss.js in variable STRING_TEMPLATE_ESCAPE_CHARACTER.
* ss.js, options-ss.js: Variable "REQUEST_TIME_OUT" has been introduced in options-ss.js.
* ss.js:    Class Locale has been updated to include new methods: setAsDefault(), getDocumentLocale() and getDefaultLocale().
* ss.js:    Addition of binary methods createBitMask() and countBits().
* ss.js:    Addition of the createBinaryNotation() method.
* ss.js:    Addition of the Id64 class.
* ss.js:    Addition of the Uuid64.create() method (which is used to create an UUID from bytes).
* ss.js:    Addition of the COMMON_DATA_TYPE_LIST object.

Removed:

* ss.js:    Methods setBackgroundColor() and getBackgroundColor() have been removed. Either all CSS properties get their own method or none will.
* ss.js, options-ss.js: variables "APPLICATION_TITLE_DEFAULT", "APPLICATION_TITLE_SEPARATOR", "APPLICATION_FULL_TITLE_DEFAULT" and "GET_APPLICATION_TITLE" have been removed from
            options-ss.js. These variables are too specific.
specific.
** ss.js, options-ss.js:    Because APPLICATION_FULL_TITLE_DEFAULT has been removed from options-ss.js, method QueryParameterList.clearUrlQueryParameterList() must now be called with a
            title.
* ss.js:    Methods hasLocaleInSession(), getLocaleFromSession(), getLocale() and deleteLocale() have been removed. See "new features" to see a list of new methods that have been added
            to Locale. The old way was to use the session storage to save and read the locale in use. The new way is to use the lang attribute of <html>, which is considered to be the
            "document locale" and should always be present.
* ss.js:    DomId.isValidCodePoint() has been replaces with DomId.isValidCharacterCode(). There is no need to specifically have to check code points. Just checking the character codes is enough.
* ss.js:    Static variables QueryParameterList.BOOLEAN_TRUE_PARAMETER_VALUE, QueryParameterList.BOOLEAN_FALSE_PARAMETER_VALUE and QueryParameterList.NULL_PARAMETER_VALUE have been renamed to
            QueryParameterList.BooleanTrueParameterValue, QueryParameterList.BooleanFalseParameterValue, QueryParameterList.NullParameterValue.

Changes:

* ss.js:    COMMON_TEXT_LIST.invalidPropertyCannotBeNullorUndefinedTemplate has two properties now (one to specify the name of the object and one to specify the name of the property).
* ss.js:    COMMON_TEXT_LIST.invalidPropertyDataTypeTemplate has one extra property now (to specify the name of the object).
* ss.js:    Method WebService.createRequest() has now only one parameter: configuration. See the method documentation for more information.
